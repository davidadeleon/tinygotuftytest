Some hacky test code to try and get the tufty2040 LCD to work

Worked on converting some code from the Pimoroni drivers for the Tufty2040 (https://github.com/pimoroni/pimoroni-pico) to get the screen to work. Building off of the work done by kenbell: https://github.com/tinygo-org/tinygo/issues/1953#issuecomment-868211121
